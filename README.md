> This is a simple API made with SpringBoot with deploy on heroku.

## About project

This API came as part of professor NÃ©lio Alves' JAVA course. 
Where I went further and created unit tests and restructured some endpoints.

## Feature list

Marketplace returns the following status codes in its API:
